### Brief Introduction:

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<hr/>

Welcome to the behind the scennes of Idea Bank, where innovation comes to life!
A dynamic and interactive web application designed to streamline creativity & ideation management.

Crafted with care using Vite and React, embracing contemporary modern web development practices to provide users with a seamless experience for smooth brainstorming, efficient organization, and effortless idea editing.

It not only fulfills the core requirements set in the task descriptions, such as; responsive design, sorting options, and inline editing‚Äîbut goes beyond with stretch goals, including; a character countdown and unobtrusive notification

To take things a step further I also added some additional features, such as basic dark/light theme's.  
<br>

**Please Note: This was part of a take home technical assaignment.**

<h1 align='center'> Development Thought Process </h1>

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## <font color=EEE8AA>App.tsx :</font>

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Small container -->
<details>
<summary> Click here to expand </summary>
<br/>
### <font color=#d48d57>Separation of concerns</font>

If this were not a technical test I would have most likely had broken the app into smaller focused components.
But for the sake of a quick & easy code review, it's easier to keep things bundled together.

**Could have also moved the following into a separate utility functions:**

- Creating custom hook for reading/fetching LocalStorage data
- the _"CRUD"_ functionality
- Local Storage Management

### <font color=#d48d57>Avoiding State Management Library</font>

For a number of reasons I have decided to avoid using a state management library.  
Namely;

1.  Simplicity & keeping overhead down for code review
2.  Development speed for take home test
3.  The ease of testing and reviewing testing

### <font color=#d48d57>Very simple Key Generation</font>

Could have a more robust and unique key generation mechanism, however for the sake of development speed and as a proof of concept I opted to use something very simple yet guaranteed unique keys.

#### <font color=008080>Future Features: </font>

- Consider adding a library for key generation
- Moving the fetching of data into a custom hook

<br/>

### <font color=#d48d57>Component Composition & Responsibility</font>

Once again, if this were not a technical test I would refactor this to break up the functionality into separate components.

_Fox example I could have the filter/sort functionality into it's own `<DropdownMenu />` component_

### <font color=#d48d57>Overall Accessibility</font>

As this is just a proof of concept I did not really focus on developing with accessibility in mind.

_For example. some things I would take into consideration across the entire app would be:_

- _ensure form fields, buttons, and other interactive elements are accessible for all users_
- _checking the colour contrast for text and backgrounds_
- _adding labels to the different form fields_

#### <font color=008080>Future Features: </font>

- Visual indication to users about the currently selected sorting option.
- Instead of using string-literals _(like `"date"` or `"alph"`)_ , would be better to have used an `enum`

<br>

## <font color=EEE8AA>IdeaCard:</font>

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Small container -->
<details>
<summary> Click here to expand </summary>
<br/>

### <font color=#d48d57>Using react-hook-forms + zod </font>

- react-hook-forms brings some simplicity/performance and helps with minimizing any unnecessary re-renders
- `zod` library helps with the validation and keeping things type-safe, as well as error handling

In combination these work well together for implementing the inline editing functionality. Preventing the need for reloading entire form or page when user interacts with editing the cards

### <font color=#d48d57>Custom Character Countdown</font>

As a little bonus I added a 'stylish' character countdown that is only rendered if edits are being made to an `IdeaCard`.
This was relatively quick and easy to implement with the help of the shadcn UI library.

#### <font color=008080>Future Features: </font>

- Adding `onBlur` function to reset the edit's
- Creating a conditional render component if no ideas in LocalStorage.
- Possibly adding search functionality

#### <font color=FF0000>Known Issues:</font>

- Character Counter issue when using a filtered state and editing/updating the title (fixed)
- The edited should have used a timestamp inttead of the _yyyy-mm-dd_ format
- Creating a new card requires updating the card and therefore changes the created date to an edited date.

### <font color=#d48d57>Part of prototyping attempt </font>

This was part of a very quick prototyping attempt, and it worked well enough that I decided to keep it in the app as a little bonus.

### <font color=#d48d57>Light & Dark Theme </font>

As this is very quick and easy to implement with the help of the shadcn UI library, I decided to add it for a bit of style and flare reasons.
I further also amended this feature to instead use the Session Storage so as not to have any conflict with the ideas stored in LocalStorage.

### <font color=#d48d57>Generating Fake/Test Ideas</font>

I wanted to create a method for the code-reviewer to create a way to generate a range of ideas, in order to easily test the functionality of the LocalStorage CRUD functionality, as well as test the sorting functionality.

#### <font color=008080>Future Features: </font>

- Adding the custom character count as part of the form

#### <font color=FF0000>Known Issues:</font>

- Not using the newly created create idea function, rather directly pushing new idea into LocalStorage
- This is not efficient and requires breaking the notification and doing a page refresh.
