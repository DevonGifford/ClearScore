### Introduction:

---

This project resulted from a time-constrained frontend assessment for ClearScore, completed within 6 to 8 hours. Utilizing modern technologies like Tailwind and ShadCN UI Library for rapid development. I prioritized simplicity, accessibility, and thorough testing.

Meeting all given core and stretch requirements, such as responsive design, sorting options, and character countdown, this project also reached the stretch goals. Additionally, I implemented some additional features, including dark/light themes, new-idea modals with quick generation of mock ideas to enhance the reviewers experience.

> [!NOTE] 
> **For reviewers:** <br/>
>
> - Please feel free to disregard boilerplate ShadCN code in components/ui
> - You can find known issues and potential future enhancements [here](https://github.com/DevonGifford/Menu--TechnicalAssignment#-known-issues--potential-improvements--).
