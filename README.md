### Introduction:

---

This project was created as part of a time-constrained frontend assessment for ClearScore. Developed within 6 to 8 hours, it utilizes modern technologies like Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI Library for rapid development. Prioritized simplicity, accessibility, and thorough testing.

The project meets all core and stretch requirements, including responsive design, sorting options, and character countdown. Additionally, it implements extra features such as dark/light themes and new-idea modals with quick generation of mock ideas.

> [!NOTE] 
> **For reviewers:** <br/>
> - Please feel free to disregard boilerplate ShadCN code in `components/ui`
> - You can find known issues and potential future enhancements [here](https://github.com/DevonGifford/Menu--TechnicalAssignment#-known-issues--potential-improvements--).
